## ðŸ“‹ Task: Create 15 Non-Trivial Queries:

Design 15 different queries that are non-trivial and interconnected, demonstrating the capabilities and operations of the selected NoSQL database.
Each example should include:<br>
- **The Query or Command:** The specific operation being performed on the database.<br>
- **Solution:** The expected result or output of the query/command.<br>
- **Detailed Explanation:** A thorough explanation of what each query/command does, why it works that way, and the context within the database.

## Utilize Database-Specific Features:
Make use of database-specific features such as:

- **Clustering:** Demonstrate how to manage and query data within a cluster.
- **Replication Factor:** Show how replication is handled, including how data is distributed across nodes and how it maintains consistency.
- **Sharding:** Provide examples of how data is partitioned across different shards, and how queries are executed in a sharded environment.

## Simulate a Node Failure:

Include an example where you simulate the failure of one or more nodes within the database cluster.<br>
Describe Solutions: Offer possible solutions for handling such failures, explaining how the database can maintain availability, consistency, or recover from the failure, depending on the CAP theorem properties it adheres to.

## Example Format:<br>
Each example should be clear and well-documented, with each step and its reasoning fully explained.<br>
Include any necessary setup commands or context required to understand the examples.

## How to run?

docker-compose up -d && ./commands.sh

## Connect to Mongo Compass
## mongodb://127.0.0.1:27117,127.0.0.1:27118 (optional)


## Create student to test clustering:

docker-compose exec -it router01 mongosh
use dorm
db.students.insertOne({
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Doe",
    DOB: new Date("1995-05-15"),
    gender: "Male",
    nationality: "American",
    emailAddress: "john.doe@example.com",
    phoneNumber: "123-456-7890",
    roomNumber: 101,
    block: "A",
    checkInDate: new Date("2023-01-01"),
    checkOutDate: new Date("2023-06-30"),
    university: "Example University",
    faculty: "Engineering"
});


After that, there will be no records about John Doe in two shard servers

## Try:

docker-compose exec -it shard01-a mongosh
use dorm
db.students.find({ lastName: "Doe" });
exit

docker-compose exec -it shard02-a mongosh
use dorm
db.students.find({ lastName: "Doe" });
exit

docker-compose exec -it shard03-a mongosh
use dorm
db.students.find({ lastName: "Doe" });
exit
